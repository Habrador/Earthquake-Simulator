# Earthquake Simulator in Unity

Simulation of how buildings behave during an earthquake. The basic ideas comes from an old school book of mine called "Differential Equations with Boundary-Value Probles" by Zill and Cullen. The chaprter itself is called "Earthquake shaking of multistory buildings." The basic idea is that you connect each floor with a spring and then simulate each spring with Euler Forward.

This is how it looks in action:

Notice that this is an old video and the Unity project is a little simpler because I had to remove some stuff to fix errors after upgrading to latest Unity version!
